# AI, AgenticAI, and AGI  

This repo is used for AI, AgenticAI, and AGI Learning. It's purpose is to cover these topics which will include setting up and configuring working project environments, documenting course leargings and my learnings as we progress through from beginner to becoming proficient with the domain knowledge.

---   

Each project, course or topic folder is organised separately within the root AI-Engineering repo root folder. It is a place for capturing the information at the initial stage and these folders should be used to build upon more knowledge and understanding by doing and not merley reading.  

Any source code should be captured within its respective \src folder and be commented to refer back to the documentation notes for more detailed understanding.  

It is my intention to solidify my knowledge by doing, therfore this repo will be my src code, explanations of the code and required understanding and related references. <span style="font-size: 15px;">**It is not a place for note taking**.</span>
